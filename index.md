### Who Am I

###### Who I Am As A Programer
I am a 2nd year CS major, and have a little expierence outside of school programing (mainly a 2 summer intership at Texas file). CS 110 will be my first major project but I am super excited to start! 
Random coding fact about me: I hate long if/else if statements like:
```
if(...){
}else if(...){
}else if(...){
}else if(...){
}
ect
```
like dawg cmon just use a switch case- look how clean this looks:
```
switch(...)
{
  case ...:
      ...
      break;
  case ...:
      ...
      break;
  case ...:
      ...
      break;
}
ect
```
###### Who I Am Normally
You can usually find me playing video games(right now Apex Legends) or playing Laccrose for the UCSD club team. I guess I always stay busy, maybe I'm inspired by the words of Robert Stevenson:
> Keep Busy at something: a busy person never has time to be unhappy  

Deep secret of mine- I low key love reality TV but dont tell anyone- here's my favorties
